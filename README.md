Want to borrow something from your neighbours?
Try BorrowIt today!

BorrowIt connects everyone in your neighbourhood in one easy-to-use app — making it simple to borrow or lend everyday items.

All you need to do is open the app, search for the tool or object you need, and if your wonderful neighbour has it — hurray, you’ve got it! 🎉

You can also rent items for a small fee through the app.

And here’s the fun part: there’s a Leaderboard!
At the end of each month, the generous neighbour who shares the most without taking any rent earns the special title — “NALLAVANAYA MANUSHYAN”  💛
